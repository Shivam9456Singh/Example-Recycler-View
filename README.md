----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RecyclerView and ListView are both Android views used to display scrollable lists of data, but RecyclerView has several advantages over ListView, including:<br><br>

-Performance<br>
  RecyclerView uses a view holder pattern to reuse views from the RecyclerView pool, which improves performance and reduces the need to create new views. This can also improve your app's responsiveness and reduce power consumption.<br><br>

-Customization<br>
  RecyclerView offers more customization features than ListView, including the ability to define how your list is laid out using LayoutManager. For example, you can lay out your list linearly, in a grid, horizontally, or vertically.<br><br>

-Flexibility<br>
  RecyclerView is more flexible for complex layouts, while ListView is easier to use for basic list layouts.<br><br>

-Efficiency<br>
  RecyclerView is more efficient for scrolling and uses less memory than ListView, especially for long lists.<br><br>

-Animations<br>
  RecyclerView makes it easier to use animations, which are smooth and simple. <br><br>
